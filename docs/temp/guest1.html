{"text":"In accordance with the [[Philosophy of Tiddlers]], documentation tiddlers are typically short and interlinked.\n\nWhen a tiddler seems as if it needs to contain subheadings, this is often a sign that it should in fact be split into several tiddlers. But it is reasonable for a [[reference tiddler|Reference Tiddlers]] to consist of an untitled introductory section followed by a titled section of details.\n\nConsistency of terminology is essential if the reader is not to become confused. Consistent typography and punctuation lend a professional quality to the documentation. Macros can improve the consistency and maintainability of the text.\n\nUse numbered lists for step-by-step instructions, and bullet points for lists whose order is arbitrary. Use a definition list in preference to a bulleted list if each bulleted item would begin with a term and a colon. If at all possible, avoid burdening the reader with a nested list.\n\nUse a table when information naturally falls into three or more columns, and also for lists of parameters, attributes, etc in [[reference tiddlers|Reference Tiddlers]].\n\nAvoid periods at the end of list items, headings and table cell text.\n\nThe documentation describes the current reality of ~TiddlyWiki. Avoid discussing future aspirations.\n","title":"Tiddler Structure","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","modified":"20210207124737959","created":"20150110183300000"}
